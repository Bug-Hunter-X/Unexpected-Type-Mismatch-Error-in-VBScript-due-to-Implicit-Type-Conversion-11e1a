This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to type checking and error handling. The `IsEmpty` function doesn't always behave as expected, leading to unexpected 'Type mismatch' errors.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version.
